1.  What’s stdint.h?
    header containing sets of integers with specified widths, i.e. int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t
2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
    It allows for i.e. better memory management
3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
    1, 4, 4, 2
4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
    424d
5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
    bfSize refers to a size, in bytes, of a bmp file, whereas biSize refers to a size, in bytes, required by the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure.
6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
    The bmp file is top-down with the origin in the upper-left corner.
7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
    biBitCount
8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
    User might not have permission to "read" or "write".
9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
    The program reads only one element of the data
10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
    3
11. What does fseek do?
    "The fseek() function sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by stream", <stdio.h>
12. What is SEEK_CUR?
    The current position of file position indicator.
